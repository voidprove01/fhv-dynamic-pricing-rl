# Dynamic Pricing Optimization Using RL in NYC For-Hire Vehicle Market

This project simulates a for-hire vehicle marketplace (e.g., Uber/Lyft) and trains a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to dynamically set ride prices. The goal is to balance supply and demand, maximize revenue, and minimize unfulfilled demand.

## Dataset
NYC For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) Trip Records Dataset

## Components
- Data cleaning & aggregation of FHV trip records
- Custom RL environment simulating rider demand & driver supply dynamics
- RL agent (PPO/DQN) training to optimize pricing policy
- Evaluation against baseline pricing strategies

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, Gym, Stable Baselines3, PyTorch, Matplotlib
